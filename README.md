# MVVMSample

It's so common for iOS projects to cram way too much code into the View Controllers that MVC has become known to mean Massive View Controller. While many remedies to this situation can be found elsewhere, some with a fairly large footprint, the aim of this project is to illustrate how View Models can be used as a low-impact first step towards moving code out of the View Controller and into a much more testable space. Dependency injection is used to handle some more complex situations while still maintaining testability.
